# Littoral-00-S2download

currently migrating functionality from theses notebooks:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jkVuJzrKiYb_d1GstZRgSN9_ng9k3LZI?usp=sharing

The tario.py file is the first example, a class that has all the tar archive interactions.
Other files will be:

1. satellite imagery download functions
2. file interactions to track progress (Currently stored as csv on google drive).  This will shift to track progress in a csv stored in a bucket that can be mounted using gcfuse (this has been tested)
3. functions for image unpsampling
4. functions for segmentation
5. functions for boundary extraction
6. functions for boundary refinement
7. functions for geotransforms
